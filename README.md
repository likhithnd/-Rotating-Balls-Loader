# 🔵 Rotating Balls Loader

This is a rotating animation of small circular balls arranged in a perfect circle using **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

The balls continuously rotate around a central point, simulating a pre-loader or loading animation seen in modern apps and websites.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Positioning, Border-radius)
- JavaScript (Math, `requestAnimationFrame`, Trigonometry)

## ✨ Features
- Dynamic ball positioning using `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()`
- Smooth rotation animation using `requestAnimationFrame()`
- Clean and minimal UI with center alignment

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use angles and radians to position elements in a circle
- How to animate using rotation and trigonometry
- Real-world use of `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animations
